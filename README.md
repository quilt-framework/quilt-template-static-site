# Quilt Static Site Application Template

This repo is a template for creating a [Quilt application](./TODO) that builds as a [static site](./TODO). To get started, clone this template repository, then run `yarn install && yarn develop` to start working on your application. Make sure to have some fun!

Once youâ€™re ready to deploy your application, run `yarn build`. Your entire application, including the HTML files and generated assets, will be placed in the `./build/public` directory. Most [hosting](./TODO) [platforms](./TODO) require this build command and output directory, and they take care of the rest.
